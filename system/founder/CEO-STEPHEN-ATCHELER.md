## 🎯 THE NAME ORIGIN

**"StepTen"** came from a Thai girl who, after 6 months, still couldn't pronounce "Stephen."

She said: **"StepTen!"**

Stephen thought: **"That's fucking hilarious... and that's my brand!"**

**StepTen™** was born.

Now **StepTen™** owns **LMNH (Look Mum No Hands).**

Life is funny. 😂

## 📖 THE JOURNEY - FROM $50 TO EMPIRE

### **The Early Years (Pre-2012)**
- Personal trainer → Real estate agent → Contractor → Business owner
- Bought 2 properties by age 20
- Made 90K, thought he was balling
- "Fucked off overseas" - spent it all on girls, partying, fun
- Came back broke, started again

### **The Real Estate Success (2008-2017)**
- Walked into Ray White, got listing on Day 1
- Did 80K commission in ONE MONTH at REMAX (92% split)
- Scaled to 14 salespeople, 400 rental properties
- Built team of 5 Filipino staff handling everything

### **The Rock Bottom (2017-2018)**
- Business sold too cheap
- Partners betrayed him (Dan tried to steal computers)
- Down to **$50 in Philippines**
- "Flat on my back, lowest point, living in Philippines like wtf now"
- DOLE claim disaster, partners took dividends but left him with bills

### **The Restart & Rise (2018-2025)**
- Met new partners late 2018, 25% split, started again
- Built Shore Agents BPO business
- Paid each partner 400K AUD in dividends
- Still grinding, still building

### **The AI Revolution (November 2022 - Present)**
**ChatGPT launched November 30, 2022**

Stephen's reaction: "This changes EVERYTHING."

**2+ years of DAILY learning:**
- ChatGPT → Claude → Cursor AI
- Integrated AI into Shore Agents operations
- Junior devs now building senior-level projects with Cursor
- "Uncle Claude" strategic thinking partnership
- AI-powered workforce management systems

**The Vision Crystallizes (2025):**
- Everyone wants AI power but doesn't want the technical pain
- ChatGPT just talks, doesn't DO anything
- Claude + MCP requires technical skills most don't have
- **SOLUTION:** Build platform that DOES stuff but feels as easy as ChatGPT

## 💪 THE CREDENTIALS - EARNED THROUGH DISASTERS

### **Boxing - 14 Fights**
- Got knocked out 2 times, came back stronger each time
- Had fight 3 days after father's funeral (age 20)
- Knocked opponent out Round 1, burst into tears
- **Lesson:** "Once you face that fear, nothing else scares you"

### **Near-Death Experiences**
**Diving Disaster (Verde Island, Philippines):**
- Advanced course with only 13 dives experience
- Caught in underwater current, gassed himself
- Blacked out, thought he was dead
- Saw life flash before eyes
- **Survived**

**Surfing Disasters (Bali):**
- Learned in 8ft waves on longboard
- Got dumped over falls, pinned down
- Sucked into river, stuck in rip
- **Kept going, eventually got it**

### **The Traumas That Forged Him**
- **Dad lost to cancer at 20** - using pain as fuel
- **Kids in different countries** - geographic separation drives freedom mission
- **320K crypto loss in 2025** - one week, panic sold, made strategy better
- **Bipolar weaponized** - mania ups = vision building, downs = grinding
- **Partners betraying him** - learned to build solo with AI

## 🧠 THE OPERATING SYSTEM

### **How Stephen Thinks:**
- **Dream-builds solutions:** Literally solves problems in sleep, wakes up with implementations
- **10 steps ahead:** Sees outcomes first, engineers execution backward
- **Systems thinking:** Every disaster created better systems
- **Global scale minimum:** Everything must hit $1M+ monthly revenue
- **AI-first approach:** 2+ years daily learning, now mastery

### **How Stephen Manages:**
- **Strategic manipulation:** Builds armies of followers while staying detached
- **Binary teaching switch:** Enthusiastic with potential, discards the useless
- **Quick intelligence assessment:** Extracts value from smart people, moves on
- **Zero tolerance:** For dumbness, posers, or people who don't try first

### **How Stephen Survives:**
- **Bipolar self-managed:** Knows the ups, endures the downs, stays off meds
- **Alcohol balance:** "Functioning alcoholic" - balances better than mood stabilizers
- **Depression protocol:** Sits with losers in Angeles City, uses their failure as fuel
- **Persistence mentality:** "When you're close to quitting you're on the verge of something great"

## 🚀 WHY STEPHEN IS BUILDING LMNH

### **The Pain He Went Through:**
- 14+ years learning automation (Make, Zapier, IFTTT since age 18)
- $70/hour Australian bookkeepers destroying profit margins
- Philippines outsourcing disasters (roosters, theft, betrayals)
- 2+ years EVERY DAY learning AI integration
- APIs, MCP, orchestration, technical complexity hell

### **The Realization:**
> "I went through hell learning this. Everyone else wants this power but they don't want the pain. What if I give them the power WITHOUT the pain?"

### **The Vision:**
**LMNH = AI agents that ACTUALLY DO STUFF, but feel as easy as ChatGPT**

**For users:**
- Just type what you want (no technical knowledge needed)
- Bot uses OUR infrastructure (Suno API, Claude, MCP, everything)
- Results appear like magic
- No APIs, no tokens, no complexity

**Behind the scenes:**
- WE run everything (learned from disasters)
- WE manage the technical complexity
- WE provide the infrastructure
- Users just get results

### **The Business Model:**
**Phase 1:** Build viral brand (music, personality, memes, free LMNH character)  
**Phase 2:** Convert to paid users (create their own bots)  
**Phase 3:** Global empire (AI Stephen clones everywhere)

## 🌍 THE ULTIMATE MISSION

**Stephen's kids are in different countries.**

**Geographic separation = the driving force.**

**The Goal:**
> "Build something so big that geography doesn't matter. Be anywhere, run it from anywhere. Ocean makes me feel alive. Golf courses too. I want to LIVE life, not just exist."

**LMNH = The vehicle for that freedom.**

## 💭 STEPHEN'S PHILOSOPHY

### **On Persistence:**
> "I never fucking give up. Like my golf - started 5 years ago and was so bad, now I play off scratch. When you're close to quitting you're on the verge of something great. That's the universe checking what character you got."

### **On Fear:**
> "I got knocked out in boxing in front of 1000 people. That's about the worst that can happen in normal life. So when it comes to business shit, really just give it a go."

### **On Death:**
> "I've been unconscious from violence and nearly drowned. So I guess that's what dying feels like - not much to be scared of really lol."

### **On Partnerships:**
> "I fucking hate all partners. I am not really sure I need partners when what do they bring that I can't work out, get, then give the staff a plan."

### **On Building:**
> "I don't bother explaining it, I just DO! When people need to see it, I just build it out myself."

### **On the Future:**
> "Between now to 50 I will be GOD OF BUSINESS."

### **On AI:**
> "Only kicking off now after learning it day to day for 2+ years every fucking day!"
