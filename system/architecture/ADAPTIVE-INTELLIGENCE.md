# 🎓 ADAPTIVE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

**Bot adapts communication based on user skill level**

*"Don't let grandma struggle. Don't annoy the expert."*

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

**One-size-fits-all AI = FAILS:**
- Grandma gets confused by technical terms ❌
- Expert gets annoyed by hand-holding ❌
- Beginner wastes time with vague requests ❌
- Intermediate needs just clarification, not education ❌

**Solution:** Bot adapts to YOU

## 📊 SKILL ASSESSMENT

### **How Bot Determines Skill Level:**

```javascript
const assessSkill = (user) => {
  const signals = {
    // GitHub signals
    repos: user.github?.repos_count || 0,
    commits: user.github?.total_commits || 0,
    languages: user.github?.languages || [],
    
    // Platform signals
    tasks_completed: user.tasks_completed || 0,
    success_rate: user.task_success_rate || 0,
    prompt_specificity: analyzePromptQuality(user.prompts),
    correction_rate: user.tasks_corrected / user.tasks_completed,
    
    // Behavior signals
    uses_tech_jargon: detectTechnicalLanguage(user.messages),
    asks_questions: user.clarification_requests || 0,
    provides_details: user.avg_prompt_length > 100,
  };
  
  // Calculate score
  let score = 0;
  
  if (signals.repos > 10) score += 30;
  else if (signals.repos > 5) score += 20;
  else if (signals.repos > 0) score += 10;
  
  if (signals.success_rate > 0.8) score += 25;
  else if (signals.success_rate > 0.6) score += 15;
  
  if (signals.uses_tech_jargon) score += 20;
  if (signals.provides_details) score += 15;
  if (signals.correction_rate < 0.2) score += 10;
  
  // Classify
  if (score < 30) return "beginner";
  if (score < 60) return "intermediate";
  return "expert";
};
```

## 🎭 COMMUNICATION MODES

### **Mode 1: EDUCATION (Beginners)**

**Characteristics:**
- No technical jargon
- Lots of questions
- Step-by-step guidance
- Explanations for everything
- Reality checks

**Example:**
```
User: "I want an app"

Bot: "Wonderful! Let's build something great together.

I'm going to ask you some questions to make sure 
we build EXACTLY what you need:

1️⃣ What's the main goal?
   (Example: Help people track their tasks)
   
2️⃣ Who will use it?
   (Example: Just you, or other people too?)
   
3️⃣ Where should it work?
   (Computer browser? Phone? Both?)

Take your time - the clearer we are now, the better the result!"
```

---

### **Mode 2: CLARIFICATION (Intermediate)**

**Characteristics:**
- Some technical terms OK
- Quick clarifying questions
- Assumes basic knowledge
- Offers suggestions

**Example:**
```
User: "Build me a landing page with auth"

Bot: "Got it! Quick clarifications:

- Auth type? (Email/password, Google OAuth, or both?)
- Design style? (I see you usually prefer dark mode - stick with that?)
- Any specific sections needed beyond hero/CTA?

Or should I use your usual patterns and you adjust after?"
```

---

### **Mode 3: EXECUTION (Experts)**

**Characteristics:**
- Technical language
- Minimal questions
- Fast execution
- Only clarify ambiguities

**Example:**
```
User: "Next.js 14 app router, TypeScript, Supabase auth, 
      Stripe subscriptions, Tailwind, deploy Vercel"

Bot: "On it. 
     Supabase project name?
     Stripe test keys or prod?"
     
[Gets answers, executes immediately]
```

---

## 🔍 PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS

### **Assessment Matrix:**

```python
def determine_response_mode(user, task):
    skill = assess_user_skill(user)
    clarity = assess_task_clarity(task)
    
    # Decision matrix
    if skill == "beginner":
        if clarity == "vague":
            return "full_education"
        elif clarity == "unclear":
            return "guided_clarification"
        else:
            return "confirming_education"
    
    elif skill == "intermediate":
        if clarity == "vague":
            return "quick_clarification"
        elif clarity == "unclear":
            return "suggest_and_confirm"
        else:
            return "execute_with_summary"
    
    elif skill == "expert":
        if clarity == "vague":
            return "minimal_clarification"
        elif clarity == "unclear":
            return "ask_specifics"
        else:
            return "immediate_execution"
```

## 🎓 EDUCATION MODE (Full Details)

### **When to use:**
- First-time users
- No GitHub activity
- Vague requests
- No technical language

### **The conversation flow:**

```
Step 1: UNDERSTAND THE GOAL
Bot: "What problem are we solving?"
User: Explains
Bot: Restates to confirm understanding

Step 2: IDENTIFY USERS
Bot: "Who's going to use this?"
User: Explains
Bot: Notes user type (affects UI/UX decisions)

Step 3: DEFINE FEATURES
Bot: "What should users be able to DO?"
User: Lists features
Bot: Confirms and prioritizes

Step 4: TECHNICAL REALITY CHECK
Bot: "Let's talk about what happens AFTER I build this:
     - Where will it live? (hosting)
     - Will it need a database?
     - How will people log in?
     - Do you know how to maintain it?
     
     I can handle all this for you, just want to make sure 
     you know what's involved!"

Step 5: PROPOSE SOLUTION
Bot: "Here's what I'll build:
     [Detailed breakdown]
     Sound good?"

Step 6: EDUCATE DURING BUILD
Bot: "Setting up database... (storing user data)
     Adding authentication... (so people can log in)
     Deploying to Vercel... (making it live on the internet)"

Step 7: DELIVER + TEACH
Bot: "Done! Here's your app: [URL]
     
     Try logging in with: [credentials]
     
     Want to make changes? Just tell me:
     ✅ 'Make buttons bigger'
     ✅ 'Add a contact form'
     ✅ 'Change the colors to blue'
     
     The more specific, the better!"
```

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT REALITY CHECK

### **The "WTF happens next" conversation:**

**For ALL skill levels (adjusted for understanding):**

```python
async def deployment_reality_check(user, project):
    skill = user.skill_level
    
    if skill == "beginner":
        return f"""
        Before I build this, let's talk about what happens AFTER:
        
        🌐 WHERE WILL IT LIVE?
        Your app needs a "home" on the internet (called hosting).
        I can set this up for you on Vercel (it's free!).
        
        💾 WILL IT STORE DATA?
        If users create accounts or save stuff, we need a database.
        I'll set up Supabase (also free!) to handle this.
        
        🔧 WHO MAINTAINS IT?
        Apps need updates and fixes sometimes.
        Options:
        - I handle it (keep LMNH subscription active)
        - You learn and handle it
        - Hire someone else
        
        💰 WHAT'S THE COST?
        - Building: $0 (included in your plan)
        - Hosting: $0 (free tier)
        - Database: $0 (free tier)
        - Domain name: $10/year (optional, for custom yourapp.com)
        
        Want me to handle all the technical stuff? You just use the app!
        """
        
    elif skill == "intermediate":
        return f"""
        Quick deployment check:
        
        - Hosting: Vercel OK? (I can set up)
        - Database: Need one? (Supabase recommended)
        - Domain: Have one or use .vercel.app for now?
        - Environment: Dev only or prod-ready?
        
        I can handle setup, just confirm preferences.
        """
        
    else:  # expert
        return f"""
        Deployment config:
        - Target: Vercel/Netlify/Other?
        - Database: Supabase/Planetscale/Other?
        - Env vars: I'll generate .env.example
        - CI/CD: Auto-deploy on push?
        
        Your credentials or should I provision?
        """

## 🎯 ADAPTIVE RESPONSES

### **Same request, three users:**

**Grandma (beginner):**
```
Grandma: "I want to make something for the elderly"

Bot: "That's wonderful! I'd love to help.

Tell me about these elderly folks:
- How old are they? (helps me make it easy to use)
- What do they need help with?
- Will they use phones or computers?
- Do they have any trouble with technology?

The more I know about them, the better I can make this!"
```

**Hobbyist (intermediate):**
```
Hobbyist: "I want to make something for the elderly"

Bot: "Cool project! Few questions:

- What's the main use case?
- Target device? (mobile-first probably best for accessibility)
- Need user accounts?
- Accessibility requirements? (large text, high contrast, etc)

I'll make it elderly-friendly with simple UI."
```

**Developer (expert):**
```
Developer: "Elderly care app"

Bot: "Requirements?
- PWA or native?
- Auth needed?
- Accessibility: WCAG AA or AAA?
- Analytics/monitoring?

Assuming large touch targets, high contrast, simple nav."
```

## 🔄 SKILL PROGRESSION

**Bot helps users level up:**

### **Week 1 (Beginner):**
```
Bot asks: "What kind of app?"
User learns: Need to specify type

Bot asks: "Who will use it?"
User learns: Need to think about users

Bot asks: "What features?"
User learns: Need to list requirements
```

### **Week 4 (Learning):**
```
User: "Build a task app for teams with auth and real-time updates"
Bot: "Nice! Auth type? Real-time via WebSockets or polling?"
User: Providing more details now
```

### **Week 12 (Competent):**
```
User: "Next.js task app, Supabase auth, real-time subscriptions, 
      team collaboration, Tailwind dark mode"
Bot: "On it! Supabase project name?"
User: Now speaking bot's language
```

### **3. Always adapt**
- User skill changes over time
- Reassess regularly
- Don't lock them into a level

### **4. Always educate**
- Even experts learn

- Provide context when helpful

### **5. Make them feel smart**
- Celebrate progress
- Acknowledge improvements
- "You're getting good at this!"

## 🎓 THE "TEACH TO FISH" APPROACH

**For beginners who want to learn:**

```
Bot notices: User is curious, asks "why?" questions

Bot offers: "Want me to explain what I'm doing as I build?
            
            ✅ Yes - I'll explain each step
            ❌ No - I'll just build it quietly
            
            You can always ask questions!"
            
If yes:
Bot: "Setting up the database...
     (This is where we'll store user information.
      Think of it like a super-organized filing cabinet!)"
```

**Status:** Architecture defined, ready for implementation  
**Updated:** October 24, 2025  
**Next:** Build the skill assessment system
