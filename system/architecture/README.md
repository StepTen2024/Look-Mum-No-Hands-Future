# üèóÔ∏è LMNH ARCHITECTURE

**Technical Strategy & System Design Documentation**

*DO NOT FUCK THIS UP - READ EVERYTHING BEFORE CODING*

---

## üìã WHAT'S IN HERE?

This folder contains ALL the technical strategy and architecture decisions for LMNH.

**Before writing ANY code:**
1. Read ALL docs in this folder
2. Understand the strategy
3. Follow the patterns
4. Don't improvise
5. Don't delete working shit

## üéØ DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### **1. ABSTRACTION IS EVERYTHING**
Users should NEVER see:
- API keys
- Blockchain addresses
- Technical jargon
- Complex workflows
- Error codes (translate to human)

### **2. WE MANAGE, THEY USE**
Platform owns:
- API usage (Suno, Claude, etc.) - we pay
- Crypto wallets (custodial) - we hold keys
- Infrastructure complexity

Users provide:
- Service tokens (Slack, GitHub) - we encrypt
- Creative input - we execute
- Zero technical knowledge required

### **3. SECURITY BY DEFAULT**
- Encrypt ALL sensitive data
- RLS on ALL database tables
- Audit trail for ALL actions
- Rate limiting on ALL endpoints
- Fail secure, not open

### **4. SCALE FROM DAY ONE**
- Async task processing
- Horizontal scaling ready
- Stateless architecture
- Queue-based workflows
- No single points of failure

### **5. PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE**
- Start simple (MVP features)
- Add complexity only when needed
- Advanced features hidden by default
- Power users can unlock more
- Never confuse beginners

## üö´ WHAT NOT TO DO

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Over-engineer the MVP
- ‚ùå Expose technical details to users
- ‚ùå Store unencrypted secrets
- ‚ùå Skip RLS policies
- ‚ùå Hardcode API keys
- ‚ùå Delete working code without backup
- ‚ùå Push breaking changes to main
- ‚ùå Skip error handling
- ‚ùå Ignore rate limits
- ‚ùå Build without reading these docs

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Follow the documented patterns
- ‚úÖ Test everything locally first
- ‚úÖ Encrypt sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Add audit logs
- ‚úÖ Handle errors gracefully
- ‚úÖ Rate limit API calls
- ‚úÖ Version your changes
- ‚úÖ Document as you build
- ‚úÖ Ask before major changes
- ‚úÖ Read ALL these docs first

## üîÑ WORKFLOW

### **Before Coding:**
1. Read relevant architecture docs
2. Understand the pattern
3. Check existing implementations (in MESSY if needed)
4. Plan your approach
5. Get approval if unsure

### **While Coding:**
1. Follow established patterns
2. Add comments for complex logic
3. Test as you go
4. Don't break working features
5. Commit small, logical changes

### **After Coding:**
1. Test end-to-end
2. Check security (encryption, RLS)
3. Verify error handling
4. Update docs if architecture changed
5. Get review before merging

## üìñ REFERENCE MATERIALS

### **Related Folders:**
- `/LMNH/assets/brand/` - Brand strategy, tokenomics, UX philosophy
- `/LMNH/assets/founder/` - Founder vision, understand the WHY
- `/LMNH/assets/personality/` - LMNH agent personality
- `/MESSY/coding-agents/` - Previous proof-of-concept (reference only)

### **Key Decisions:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI likely) or Next.js API routes
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS)
- **AI:** Claude API (Sonnet 4)
- **Blockchain:** Solana (for $LMNH token)
- **Hosting:** TBD (Vercel for frontend likely)

## üéì LEARNING RESOURCES

**If you're new to any tech:**
- Supabase: https://supabase.com/docs
- Solana Web3.js: https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/
- Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs
- Prisma/Supabase: https://www.prisma.io/docs

**Don't guess. Read. Then build.**

## üö® EMERGENCY CONTACTS

**If you fuck something up:**
1. Don't panic
2. Don't try to fix by guessing
3. Stop and assess damage
4. Check git history (what changed?)
5. Revert if needed
6. Ask for help

**Git safety:**
```bash
# Before making big changes
git checkout -b feature-name
git commit -m "clear message"

# If you fuck up
git log --oneline
git checkout main
git reset --hard <last-good-commit>
```

## üéØ THE MISSION

**Build a platform where ANYONE can create AI coding agents...**
- Without knowing how to code
- Without understanding APIs
- Without crypto knowledge
- Without technical skills

**"Look Mum No Hands" - Make it THAT easy.**
