A platform where ANYONE (grandmas, kids, non-technical people) can create AI agents that:
- Write code
- Deploy apps
- Integrate with services (Slack, GitHub, Suno, etc.)
- Learn from every interaction
- Improve over time
- Require ZERO technical knowledge to use

### **What makes LMNH different?**
1. **Complete Deployment:** Others give code. We give working apps.
2. **Multi-Dimensional Learning:** Bot learns from EVERYTHING (actions, not just chat)
3. **Adaptive Intelligence:** Bot adapts to user skill (beginner → expert)
4. **Behavioral Intelligence:** Understand users' lives through actions
5. **Zero Complexity:** Users never see technical details (custodial wallets, etc.)
6. **Solana Token:** $LMNH for viral growth and economy

### **Who is it for?**
- Primary: Non-technical users who have ideas but can't code
- Secondary: Developers who want faster workflows
- Ultimate: EVERYONE - democratizing AI agent creation

### **What's the business model?**
- Free tier: Build and deploy (limited)
- Pro tier: $20/month (unlimited, premium features)
- Enterprise: $100+/month (dedicated, white-label)
- Token economy: $LMNH for viral distribution
- Revenue: Subscriptions + affiliate recommendations

2. Follow the documented pattern
3. If not documented, document it first
4. Don't improvise

### **When Stuck:**
1. Re-read relevant `/system/` docs
2. Check `/MESSY/` for working examples
3. Ask before making major decisions
4. Document what you learn

### **Before Committing:**
1. Test locally
2. Check security (no exposed secrets)
3. Verify RLS policies work
4. Test with both beginner and expert users
5. Update docs if you changed architecture

## 🎯 THE ULTIMATE GOAL

**Build a platform where:**

A grandmother can say:
"I want to help elderly people with memory"

And LMNH responds:
"I understand. I'll build you a memory training app with photo quizzes. 
It'll have large buttons, simple navigation, and track progress over time.
Give me 15 minutes..."

[15 minutes later]

"Done! Your app is live at: https://memory-helper.vercel.app
Here's the login for testing: [credentials]
Try it out and let me know what to adjust!"

**And it ACTUALLY WORKS.**

**THAT'S the goal. Build THAT.** 🎯
